# Countries: Tier-2 Front-End Project

## Overview
This project was build to consolidate my knowledge of React.js and explore props, componenets, states (useState() & useEffect()), higher order functions, call multiple APIs, make APIs interact and explore different libraries to perform a given task.

## Heroku Deployment Url

## Features
- A user can search a given country to find out the capital city of that country, the population, flag(Country API) and the weather temperature of that day (Weather API).
- A user has to input over one character to the search bar in order to view options.
- A user can press a button to rotate which country they want to view in the output.

## Running the project
- npm install node.js
- npm start


## Dependencies

- React 
- React-Dom

## To do

- Make more responsive
- Make sure that you handle errors! 
- Account for an API not responding, etc.
- Make sure that your node_modules are in your .gitignore instead of on GitHub.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
